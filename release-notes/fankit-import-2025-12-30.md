# Release notes: CIG Fankit import (2025-12-30)

Summary
-------
Imported a selection of the official Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) Fankit into the repository for documentation and UI usage. This includes logos, wallpapers, fonts, audio snippets, and guidelines.

What changed
------------
- Added `assets/fankit/` with approved assets (logos, wallpapers, fonts, audio samples, CTM model previews) and `LICENSE_CIG_FANKIT.txt` (verbatim copy of TOS/license found in source).  
- Generated `assets/fankit/fankit-manifest.json` (path, size, sha256, source, imported_at).  
- Added import tooling: `scripts/import-fankit.sh` and `scripts/import-fankit.ps1`.  
- Added validation script: `scripts/check-fankit-manifest.sh` and CI workflow `.github/workflows/fankit-manifest-check.yml`.  
- Documented usage and update path in `docs/CIG-Fankit.md`.  
- Added demo docs page `docs/examples/CIG-Fankit-Demo.md`.

License & Compliance
--------------------
- The import includes a copy of the license/TOS as `assets/fankit/LICENSE_CIG_FANKIT.txt` — this must remain unchanged and reviewed before merging.
- The default process blocks imports when a license/TOS is missing; contributors must confirm rights to include any asset.

How to update
-------------
Use the provided import scripts to refresh or add assets from a local Fankit source:

- Unix:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/import-fankit.sh /path/to/Fankit_Source
  ```
- Windows PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  ./scripts/import-fankit.ps1 -SourcePath "C:\Path\To\Fankit"
  ```

CI
--
The `.github/workflows/fankit-manifest-check.yml` workflow validates the manifest and license on PRs/changes under `assets/fankit/**`.

Notes & Next Steps
------------------
- Legal review recommended if this repository will redistribute assets beyond documentation/demo usage.
- If any asset is found to be disallowed, remove it and update the manifest.
