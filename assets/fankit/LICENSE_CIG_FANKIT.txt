# LICENSE_CIG_FANKIT (placeholder)

This file is the copy of the original license/TOS that is shipped with the CIG Fankit you imported.

DO NOT edit this file manually. It is copied by `scripts/import-fankit.*` from the source Fankit folder and must remain verbatim.

If you run `scripts/import-fankit.sh /path/to/Fankit` or `scripts/import-fankit.ps1 -SourcePath C:\Path\To\Fankit`, the license will be copied here.
