# Wrap Up — 2025-12-29

Summary of the recent local remediation work and task closure (per SC_MANAGER_V7 rules):

- Remediations completed: replaced `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production code, improved error handling, and updated unit tests where necessary.
- TODOs: non-trivial TODOs were tracked with `TRACKED-xxx` references and documented in `docs/TRACKED_TODOS.md`.
- CI & Checks: `scripts/check_forbidden_patterns.sh` passes; Local CI (PowerShell) and selective integration tests were executed successfully.
- Coverage: Local `cargo-tarpaulin` produced `.profraw` files; on Windows `tarpaulin` parsing failed; after installing `llvm-tools-preview` I merged profraws and generated an HTML report with `llvm-cov` at `app/target/tarpaulin/html/index.html`.
- CI workflow: Added `.github/workflows/run-ci-checks.yml` and tested local GitHub Actions run via `./scripts/run-gh-actions-local.sh` (act).

Open tasks / hold points:

- **Push & PR**: still withheld until official release signal. (TODO remains `not-started`.)

If you confirm, I will remain on standby; no further actions will be taken until you say `release`.
