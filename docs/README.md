# Documentation (V7)

This documentation environment is intentionally minimal and *authoritative files are the two V7 documents*:

- `SC_MANAGER_V7_PART1_FOUNDATION.md`
- `SC_MANAGER_V7_FEATURE_MATRIX_AND_COMPLETION.md`

All documentation in this repo should be derived from and conform to those two files. Any other documentation is intentionally removed to avoid drift.

Local preview (requires mkdocs):

1. Install: `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material` (or use your preferred static site generator)
2. Preview: `mkdocs serve` (site available at http://127.0.0.1:8000)
3. Build: `mkdocs build`

This repo contains `mkdocs.yml` to provide a minimal navigation that exposes the two authoritative files.
