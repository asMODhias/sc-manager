# Release v4.0.0 â€” Final

**Release date:** 2025-12-23
**Status:** Released (local)

## Summary
v4.0.0 consolidates the IDC-10 product definition into canonical docs under `docs/`, formalizes document metadata and TOC, and adds a local-first release checklist for running unit, integration and E2E smoke tests locally.

## Highlights
- Canonical IDC-10 docs placed in `docs/` and root duplicates archived in `docs/archive/`.
- Added YAML frontmatter and TOC for IDC-10 docs for better machine-readability and navigation.
- Created `docs/release_notes/v4-draft.md` and finalized as `docs/release_notes/v4.md`.

## Known issues
- Gateway binary (`services/gateway`) requires minor API adjustments to compile with `hyper` 1.x. Tracked in `docs/issues/0001-axum-feature.md`. Core, adapters, UI and E2E tests are green locally.
